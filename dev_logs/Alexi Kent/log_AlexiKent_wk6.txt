Dev Log #6

I was on vacation for the majority of the week, so no work was done.

Uploaded my first commit to the GitHub

Fixed a typo issue that was stopping the database from populating properly which in turn stopped the login page from working properly.

Had to catch up on other assignments so not much else was done.
Editing of users was still bugged.
